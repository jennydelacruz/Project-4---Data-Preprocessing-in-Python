# Project-4-Data-Preprocessing-in-Python

This project, part of Udemy's Business Intelligence Analyst course, addresses absenteeism at a company during work time. The goal is to predict employee absenteeism given several factors, by analzying the results of a linear regression.

In this project I have pre-processed data in Python, to then be given the results of the linear regression to analyze and visualize. This exercise assumes the linear regression model is performed by a fictional machine learning team.

The next steps of the project are to connect Python with MySQL workbench to finish preparing the data for interpretation, and finally, visualize the results in Tableau. 

In this first part, I have used the Pandas library in Python to preprocess the raw given data. Some of the skills learned in this first part include:
- importing csv files.
- creating copies of the raw data dataframe.
- dropping columns.
- creating dummy variables. 
- grouping dummy varibles into broader categories. 
- using the loc property. 
- concatenating columns.
- reordering and renaming columns.
- creating checkpoints.
