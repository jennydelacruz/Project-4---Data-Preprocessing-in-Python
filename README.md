# Project-4-Data-Preprocessing-in-Python

This project, part of Udemy's Business Intelligence Analyst course addresses absenteeism at a company during work time. The goal is to predict employee absenteeism given several factors, by analzying the results of a linear regression.

In this project I have pre-processed data in Python, to then be given the results of the linear regression. This exercise assumes the linear regression model is  performed by an imaginary machine learning team.

The next steps of the project are to connect Python with MySQL workbench, to finalize preparing the data for interpretation and results visualization in Tableau. 

In this first part, I have used the Pandas library in Python to preprocess the raw given data.
